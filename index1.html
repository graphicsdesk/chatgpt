  After Caleb, CC ’26, submitted his Progression Three research paper for University Writing—the most heavily weighted assignment in the class—he received a sparkling A for his work. His trick? Two of the essay’s seven pages were AI-generated using ChatGPT, undetected by his professor, he said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Yet Caleb, who spoke to Spectator on the condition of anonymity fearing academic consequences and is named using a pseudonym, said he does not believe he cheated.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I was still the one who largely organized and structured the material,” Caleb said. “I think that maybe my writing skills didn’t improve as much necessarily, but I think I used it in a limited enough case that it wasn’t cheating.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As Columbia’s <a href="https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/node/444566">Integrity Week</a> begins, noticeably absent from the programming is an explicit session focusing on ChatGPT. However, as it makes its way into the classroom, ChatGPT has raised ethical considerations. Students told Spectator they have been using the software—either copying and pasting verbatim, or taking ideas from the bot—for assignments ranging from coding to essays over the past four months.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Derek Lorenzo, GS ’23, president of the Columbia University chapter of the Google Developer Student Clubs, said that ChatGPT with its current capabilities may be able to pass 1000-level coding courses at Columbia.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s definitely possible to use it to solve some pretty basic problems,” Shmuel Berman, SEAS ’24, a teacher’s assistant for Data Structures in Java and former teacher’s assistant for Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Java, said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Teaching assistants in introductory-level computer science classes are learning to detect when students use ChatGPT, Berman said. He described how the team of TAs in Introduction to Java inputted homework questions into the software and cross referenced them with students’ homework answers while grading.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You can have a general idea of how it will approach [a homework problem], which is usually a little bit different from how a typical student would do it,” Berman said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, Caleb told Spectator he used the bot to submit assignments in professor Paul Blaer’s Introduction to Java course without getting caught.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I think [that] is actually a valid use for [ChatGPT] because it’s really just an aid, and I have to know what I want and how to take that and import it into the scenario that I’m looking at,” Caleb said. “Like I'm the one applying what’s being produced.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the higher-level coding classes, the usefulness of ChatGPT decreases, Lorenzo said; in 3000- or 4000-level courses, assignments are likely too specific for ChatGPT to pass.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The assignment isn’t to just generate this code, they want it a certain way,” Lorenzo said. “And that may be harder to replicate with an AI-generated code.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Lorenzo said that one could plug an AI-generated solution back into ChatGPT or a similar bot and ask how likely it is that the work was done using AI. If a TA is familiar with a student’s work and suddenly their style drastically changes, the TA may be suspicious of whether the work was done exclusively by the student, he said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While different professors have different policies regarding the use of ChatGPT in their classroom, “more advanced classes are going to say it’s probably not [cheating], just because it doesn’t have the capability to cheat yet,” Berman said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Some students have also called into question the effectiveness of ChatGPT in generating paragraphs that a user can copy and paste into an essay, discussion post, or other written assignment.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Lyali Shaikh, CC ’26, said she experimented with ChatGPT and put a paper prompt—an op-ed taking a stance on South Asian representation in Hollywood—into the software. Yet, she found that it could not make a proper argument.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It's not capable of independent thought,” Shaikh said. “It wasn’t able to formulate a specific point of view and then support that with evidence.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Other students have taken issue with the ethics behind copying and pasting directly from ChatGPT. Students told Spectator that they do consider direct copying to be cheating, just like it is cheating to copy word for word from SparkNotes or Google Translate in a language class. Julia Lange, GS ’26, said that when used, students should be citing ChatGPT as they would a book or another source.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “People should be made aware when what they’re reading is not the work of a person, it’s the work of a computer. Because I think it devalues in a lot of ways,” Lange said. “If you’re an art collector, and you buy a painting and you think it’s worth a million dollars because some artist painted it, then you find out that it was just some schmuck, you’re not getting what you think you’re getting.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Meira Saffra, BC ’24, works in the Barnard Writing Center, which, according to Saffra, aims to “advocate for the voice of the writer.” For Saffra, “writing ultimately is an art form.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You have the ability to tailor it to sound like your voice and put your fingerprint on it,” Saffra said. “To generalize information output doesn’t speak to me as a student or speak to the learning process.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In addition to quoting ChatGPT-generated content verbatim, students told Spectator that they have used the bot to generate ideas for essays. Brendon, CC ’26, spoke to Spectator on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear that his use of the software could be construed as unfair and result in academic consequences and is being named using a pseudonym. He said he “used it during editing to come up with ideas” when writing essays, but did not copy and paste directly from the software, comparing it to more of a “ghostwriter.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If you’re gonna make modifications, then I guess it’s fine. But if you’re just gonna copy paste, then I don’t think that’s right,” he said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Jeffery Wolberg, SEAS ’25, said he would not consider using the software for ideas as cheating.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s just codifying prior things that have been written on the internet, and giving them to you and almost spoon-feeding them to you,” Wolberg said. “You shouldn’t use it directly. But there’s no problem in hearing something and then using it in an essay, and it might not be 100 percent original, but most ideas aren’t.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A major deterrent to using ChatGPT for many students is the <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/arts-and-culture/2023/01/26/chatgpt-generates-new-possibilities-for-students-but-experts-question-its-accuracy/">question of the bot’s accuracy</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s only as good as the data that came in,” Lorenzo said. “Sometimes the data is wrong. That’s not really the issue so much as the combining of all the data can cause some sort of issues there,” Lorenzo said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Computer science major Lyali Shaikh, CC ’26, said she avoids ChatGPT because she is wary of its accuracy. “I don’t actually ever use it for comp sci classes because I don’t think it will be accurate, but I try to compare it with my own sometimes,” she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Elias Tzoc-Pacheco, SEAS ’23, University senator for the Engineering Student Council, said that students are fascinated by the topic. He said students have been studying artificial intelligence for years, specifically in labs over the summer.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s hard to not see ChatGPT and AI in general as a tool that can be used, especially in CS,” Tzoc-Pacheco said. “You’re always trying to learn new methods for doing something, using new software, using a new program. And a big part of AI and machine learning is integrated into what students are interested in, and people find that really interesting.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When it comes to using AI tools to assist students with the writing process, Tyler Kim, SEAS ’26, and Quan Tan, GS ’24, are coding a potential solution.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The pair is developing an AI writing tutor app named Scraft, the result of an idea Kim came up with while working for the writing center during his gap year. Unlike ChatGPT, Scraft does not generate writing for students. Rather, it is designed to guide students through the writing process.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We saw this as potentially controversial because it takes over the research process, the writing process, and even the drafting process,” Tan said. “When we spoke to educators, they were worried because if you find the right prompt, you can essentially outsource all your work to AI.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The goal of Scraft is to assist students in improving their writing skills with the help of AI technology, a goal Kim views as relatively novel.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re throwing the question: How can you think more critically with the help of AI?” Kim said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Last semester, Kim ran a beta-test of the software in his University Writing course. Students in his Data and Society section used Scraft as an instructional tool while writing their fourth progression, an op-ed. The feedback he received largely focused on the linear nature of the program, which guides students step-by-step through a plan, draft, and write process, he said. Kim and Tan agree that this linear model is not the way most students write on their own.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We just realized that writing is not really linear, it’s more recursive. That’s why we like to listen to those students’ feedback,” Kim said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Kim and Tan are working on a second iteration of Scraft, which aims to revise its model to be more recursive, in which each step is informed by the step that preceded it. Rather than writing from introduction to conclusion, recursive writing allows students to think through their process by moving freely from idea to idea. Like ChatGPT, Scraft is still limited in its ability to mimic the natural flow of human-produced writing.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Sina Ahdoot, CC ’23, 2023 representative of Columbia College Student Council, said that institutions and individuals should welcome the usage of AI as it’s unlikely to go away and likely to keep improving in the future.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “People need to accept that technology is evolving very fast, and we need to develop new procedures for academic integrity, using the old fundamentals in order to catch up with the tech revolution,” Ahdoot said. “It’s a reality that Columbia and many other institutions have to grapple with in the near future.”
