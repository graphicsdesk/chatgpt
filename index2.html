            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As students have begun to experiment with ChatGPT, professors are working to adapt their classrooms to the new technology.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Paulo Blikstein, an associate professor of communications, media, and learning technologies design at Teachers College, is skeptical that ChatGPT and other AI softwares could be effectively banned.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’re not in 1975 when you could just cut a wire or something,” Blikstein said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Given the accessibility of ChatGPT as a free online tool, some have noted that the software can potentially democratize cheating.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “There were always students who would pay for essay-writing services online. But [in] that case, you had to actively reach out to these services and pay for them,” Tyler Kim, SEAS ’26, a computer science student developing an AI writing instructor, said. “But now ChatGPT is in everybody’s hands and then everybody knows that it is capable of writing essays [and it’s] essentially not detectable.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Blikstein, however, cautioned against viewing AI technology as a “democratizing” agent, or a “tech savior.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “That’s something to be careful about—not believing in this discourse of technological fetishism, that technology will save the world,” Blikstein said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Blikstein said he views the rise of writing-generating AI software to be an indicator that there will be a shift in the genre conventions deemed acceptable in college-level writing assignments. In his courses, Blikstein writes his prompts so that students must use their own personal experience to inform their writing, something AI cannot replicate.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It will force instructors to say, well, maybe instead of an essay about the life of Plato … how are the ideas of Plato related to your childhood or your personal experience as a student? Or how is Plato related to your culture?” Blikstein said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Started here
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When Blikstein came to the United States from Brazil for his graduate studies, the type of standardized college writing was “kind of shocking” to him, he said. He was used to being able to incorporate creative elements into his writing—it was common to begin an essay with a poem, for example.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If you are from a culture in the U.S. or from a country where music is something huge in your life, why shouldn’t you be able to start something with some lyrics from a song, or maybe write something in a more poetic form because it’s just something that is more meaningful to you?” Blikstein said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In addition to lacking a creative or individual perspective, currently, ChatGPT’s writing abilities are comparable to “junior high or high school students,” according to Sue Mendelsohn, director of the Writing Center, associate director of first-year writing, and senior lecturer in the discipline of English and comparative literature.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Megan Lonsinger, a University Writing instructor and doctoral candidate in English, called the caliber of writing ChatGPT “extremely mediocre at best” and said it only seems to provide a summary or paraphrase of information rather than advancing an argument forward through analysis. This kind of writing would not earn students an A, in Lonsinger’s opinion.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If I were to submit that, I know that my advisors would not be happy with it. Because I’m not making an argument. I’m not actually saying something new about how to understand this thing. I’m just repeating what the text itself says,” Lonsinger said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Mendelsohn cautioned that ChatGPT encourages the standardization of writing, which decenters the importance of individuality and self-expression. Rather than allowing students to write from their unique perspectives, AI generative writing bots take away the human voice and perpetuate the belief that standard English is the “correct” form of English, she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “What we know about multiple language speakers … is that our range of expressive abilities is tied to the language we experience and learn things in. So there’s something you can say in your home language or regional language that gets at something that you couldn’t say in another language,” Mendelsohn said. “This notion that there’s one correct language or one correct register of English is simply false. And that falseness cuts off our expressive ability, our full expressive capability.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Given the newness of the software, Mendelsohn said she asks her students to not use AI tools at “any part of their writing process,” as she wants them to rely on each other as collaborators for assistance instead.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Lonsinger said she will not recommend her students use ChatGPT in her class.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s not something I will employ. It’s not something I would recommend other writing instructors employ,” Lonsinger said. “I am very strongly against using it, actually—to write essays at the very least.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Another current issue with ChatGPT is its usage of incorrect or, in some cases, completely nonexistent sources. When Lonsinger tried out the application out of curiosity of its efficacy and writing ability, asking it to analyze a book she is using as a source for her dissertation, the software gave her a nonexistent citation, she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It cited authors that exist, but it said that they had written books and quoted those books. Those books don’t exist,” Lonsinger said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Amir Feder, a postdoctoral researcher at the Data Science Institute, sees potential for ChatGPT to be used in the categorizing and labeling of groups of data. However, the current infrastructure is too unreliable to be used without human input, he said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “This isn’t progress where we can kind of replace the human in the loop there. But it can certainly allow us to do many more things and think about many more tasks,” Feder said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While ChatGPT can cluster groups of data together, it lacks the precision required of advanced analytical work.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “As an assistive writing tool, it’s going to be completely transformational,” Feder said. “But if we want to generate something that’s factual that we are relying on, there’s nothing in the way that it’s trained to make us confident that it will do so.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Aside from its technical and stylistic capability, Lonsinger believes that the use of ChatGPT under any circumstances is an act of plagiarism, constituting an academic integrity violation.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  She also said that she feels that it is a students’ responsibility to not “outsource” their thinking so that they can think for themselves.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “If you were to use it to code for example, but you want it to write the code for you, you don’t want to write it yourself. What are you doing here? And what else are you going to be doing with your time?” Lonsinger said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  These issues are part of a dialogue among professors who are reimagining curricula in writing programs to center the idea of writing as a practice of critical thinking. Part of this restructuring involves moving the general focus away from the final product and towards the process of writing itself, something Nicole Wallack, director of the Undergraduate Writing Program and senior lecturer in the discipline of English and comparative literature, believes to be necessary.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We’ve been trying to get this word out for a long time that potentially all of us, across all of our disciplines, need to rethink our ways that we ask students to work with the materials of our classes through writing, if we want them—want you—to understand writing as a form of thinking,” Wallack said. “And we can’t do that if …  writing is always and only the product that we assess at the end.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For Bauer and Lonsinger, the issue boils down to a loss of control.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Essentially, when you’re using these tools, [you’re] giving up control into the hands of some company that owns this model,” Bauer said. “And that is something, actually, I’m very uncomfortable about.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Lonsinger expressed a concern with students giving up control of their writing and individual voice, especially when it comes to receiving feedback and growing as a student.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I don’t see how somebody can walk away from that if they actually care about learning, if they actually care about expressing themselves or their opinion,” Lonsinger said. “It would deeply unsettle me to know that I would never know if I was intelligent enough that I had to rely on something else just to write for me.”
